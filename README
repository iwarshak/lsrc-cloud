This is a demonstration app for my Lonestar Ruby Conf talk "Rails in the Cloud"

It is a simple photo processing app that runs on Amazon EC2, S3, SimpleDB, Cloudfront, and SQS

Pictures are uploaded directly from the browser to S3. S3 returns a redirect, which 
hits the webserver and generates a database entry in SimpleDB as well as jobs which 
go into the SQS queue.

Each job is a picture conversion. We are using ImageMagick to apply different transformations
to it: resizing, effects, text adding, etc. 

A separate processing daemon pulls jobs from SQS, downloads the uploaded image, performs the 
transformation, updates the database and uploads the new images to S3. There is also a Cloudfront
distribution setup to mirror the S3 bucket, so images are served from the Cloudfront CDN. 

To get the app bootstrapped, there are a few things you have to do.

# Simple DB - Setup the Picture domain
RightAws::ActiveSdb.establish_connection
Picture.create_domain

# Create the S3 Bucket
s3 =  RightAws::S3.new
processed_bucket = s3.bucket('pictr', true)

# Cloudfront distribution
acf = RightAws::AcfInterface.new
dist = acf.create_distribution 'pictr.s3.amazonaws.com', 'lsrc ruby demo'
